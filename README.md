<h1><b>DemonSocial:</h1>
The social network for all those missplaced by the death of Demonsaw;
but with a more social-media oriented aspect. An app built around crypto/privacy technology, 
with the aim of creating a community where one can feel wanted/appreciated.
This is only an idea at the moment, and may never come to be, but we'll see how it goes.
